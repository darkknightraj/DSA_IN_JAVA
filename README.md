# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my DSA journey 👨‍💻  
I am solving problems using **Java** and focusing on **pattern-based learning** to build strong problem-solving skills for top tech companies.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Master Data Structures & Algorithms
- Crack high-paying SDE roles
- Improve problem-solving ability
- Write clean and optimized code

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

Instead of solving random problems, I follow a **pattern-based approach**:

👉 Identify pattern → Learn logic → Solve multiple problems → Master it

This helps in:
- Faster problem recognition in interviews
- Writing optimized solutions
- Reducing brute force thinking
